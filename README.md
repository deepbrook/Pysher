[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/Pysher.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/Pysher)

# Pysher

`pysher` is a python module for handling pusher websockets. It is based on @ekulyk's `PythonPusherClient`. 
 A key difference is the dropped support for pre-3.5 Python versions.

This fork is meant as a continuation of the project, and is currently in **maintenance mode**.

The author is no longer actively using the library, but PRs including fixes, updates and features
are welcome and encouraged.

## Installation

Simply run `python setup.py install` - or install via pip `pip install pysher`.

This module depends on websocket-client module available from: <http://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client>

## Example

Example of using this pusher client to consume websockets:

```python
import pysher

# Add a logging handler so we can see the raw communication data
import logging
root = logging.getLogger()
root.setLevel(logging.INFO)
ch = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
root.addHandler(ch)

pusher = pysher.Pusher(appkey)

def  my_func(*args, **kwargs):
    print("processing Args:", args)
    print("processing Kwargs:", kwargs)

# We can't subscribe until we've connected, so we use a callback handler
# to subscribe when able
def connect_handler(data):
    channel = pusher.subscribe('mychannel')
    channel.bind('myevent', my_func)

pusher.connection.bind('pusher:connection_established', connect_handler)
pusher.connect()

while True:
    # Do other things in the meantime here...
    time.sleep(1)
```

Sending pusher events to a channel can be done simply using the pusher client supplied by pusher.  You can get it here: <https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-python>

    import pusher
    pusher.app_id = app_id
    pusher.key = appkey

    p = pusher.Pusher()
    p['mychannel'].trigger('myevent', 'mydata')
    
## Performance
Pysher relies on websocket-client (websocket-client on pyPI, websocket import in code), which by default does utf5 validation in pure python. This is somewhat cpu hungry for lot's of messages (100's of KB/s or more). To optimize this validation consider installing the wsaccel module from pyPI to let websocket-client use C-compiled utf5 validation methods (websocket does this automatically once wsaccel is present and importable).
